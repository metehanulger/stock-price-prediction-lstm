📈 Stock Price Prediction with LSTM (NVDA Case Study)
This project is a Deep Learning application designed to predict future price trends for NVIDIA (NVDA) stock. It utilizes the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies in time-series data.

🚀 Project Overview
Predicting stock market movements is challenging due to high volatility. This project approaches the problem by:

Predicting Percentage Change: Instead of forecasting raw prices, the model learns from daily percentage changes (pct_change). This helps the model generalize better across different price levels.

Time-Series Analysis: The model looks at the past 60 days of market data to forecast the trend for the next 21 days.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Data Source: Automated data retrieval from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.

Pre-processing: Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler into a range of (-1, 1) to optimize the training process.

Model Architecture:

2 x LSTM Layers (50 units each) for capturing temporal patterns.

Dropout Layers (0.2) to prevent overfitting and improve model reliability.

Dense Output Layer for final prediction.

Visualization: Interactive and high-fidelity charts generated with Plotly.

🧠 Key Learnings
Through this project, I explored:

Data Normalization: Why scaling data is crucial for neural networks.

RNN/LSTM Logic: How "memory" in a network helps in analyzing sequential data like stock prices.

Overfitting Control: The importance of Dropout layers in creating models that work on unseen data.
